Covid-19 live data app
These are all the project files for the covid-19 live data tracker app. 
The installation APK is in the master directory (home screen) labeled: "Covid-19 live data.apk", please use that to download the app. The rest is android studio files. 


Description:
There are a lot of websites and apps out there that provide users with latest COVID-19 data. 
But they all have one thing in common, they all have ADs. These ADs ruin the user experience 
of quickly updating themselves on the latest cases and more. So this app was created to strip 
down the data to the basics with NO Ads! Horray!
